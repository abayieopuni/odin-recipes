        <h4>How to Make steak and potato foil packets </h4>
        <p>Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this  steak and potato foil packets: </p>
        <ol>
        
            <li>Prepare an outdoor grill, preferably a charcoal grill, for medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Place potatoes in a microwave-safe dish and cook on high until they are tender with a bite, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide steak, potatoes, onions, red and green bell pepper, and carrots evenly onto 4 to 6 squares of aluminum foil.
                 Add 1 tablespoon butter and a little fresh garlic to each pack; fold foil over the top to close each packet tightly.</li>
            <li>Place foil packs on the hot side of the grill. Cook for 5 minutes. Carefully open one foil pack to check for steak doneness. </li>
            <li>If steak is not cooked to your taste after 5 minutes, continue to cook, checking for doneness every few minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
        </ol>
