        <h3>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper </h3>
        <p>This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic,
             and chives. I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.</p>
